# Turkey, Guess the City Game via Turtle Library

This simple game expects the user to type a city from the **Turkiye** and for every correct answer the game adds 1
score to the scoreboard.

<hr />

### Note:
* GUI is written in **Turkish**
* **pandas** and **turtle** modules are required to execute.
* Another Python file is added as **check_coordinate** to check and update the related coordinate for the city if the user 
wants to change it.
